INTRODUCTION                                    *lightswitch*
Lightswitch enables automatic response to macOS appearance theme changes. At
startup, and repeatedly at a user-defined interval, Lightswitch checks the
value of the appearance theme and updates `background` accordingly.

Lightswitch only functions on macOS. It has no effect on other platforms.

OPTIONS                                         *lightswitch-options*

|g:lightswitch-interval|                          *lightswitch-interval*
The time, in milliseconds, between checks of the current OS appearance theme.

This value must be set at startup (in your `.vimrc` or similar) as
Lightswitch's background timer is created as soon as the plugin is loaded. If
not set, the default value is 1000.

If set to zero or a negative number, Lightswitch will not initialize its
background timer and will only perform the OS appearance check once, at
startup.
